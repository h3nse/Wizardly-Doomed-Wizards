# wizardly_Doomed_wizards

A mobile game made for a school project. In the game, two players in the same room fight head to head in a potion brewing duel. 
Scanning QR-codes placed around the room to collect ingredients for their potions, then either chugging them at their opponent to impose an effect, or drinking them themselves to gain their benefit.
